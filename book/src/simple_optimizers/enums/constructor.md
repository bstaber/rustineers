# Constructors

We define convenience constructors for each optimizer. These make usage simpler and avoid manually writing match arms.

```rust
{{#include ../../../../crates/simple_optimizers_enums/src/optimizers.rs:constructors}}
```

This helps create optimizers in a more idiomatic and clean way.
