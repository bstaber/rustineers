# Welcome!

Welcome to Rustineers, a dive into the Rust programming language through the lens of applied mathematics and science. There are already several high-quality resources available for learning Rust:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) â€“ a comprehensive introduction to Rust.
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) â€“ hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) â€“ learn by studying runnable examples.

You can find even more learning material at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This book is meant to be complementary to those great resources. Our goal is to learn Rust by implementing practical examples drawn from applied mathematics, including:

- Machine Learning  
- Statistics and Probability  
- Optimization  
- Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)  
- Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)  
- And other topics from engineering and physics  

Each chapter centers around a specific scientific algorithm or computational problem. We explore how to implement it idiomatically in Rustâ€”sometimes in multiple styles.

## Difficulty Levels

To help you navigate the material, each chapter is marked with a difficulty level using ðŸ¦€ emojis:

- ðŸ¦€ â€” Beginner-friendly  
- ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ â€” Intermediate  
- ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ â€” Advanced

As this is a work in progress, the difficulty levels might not always be well chosen.

## Roadmap

Here's an unordered list of examples of topics that could be added to the book:

- [x] 1D Ridge regression.
- [x] Simple first-order gradient descent algorithms.
- [ ] Multivariate regression algorithms (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic-net).
- [ ] Classification algorithms: logistic regression.
- [ ] Some clustering algorithms: K-means, Gaussian mixtures.
- [ ] Some MCMC algorithms: MH, LMC, MALA.
- [ ] Numerical methods for solving ODEs: Euler, Runge-Kutta.
- [ ] Numerical methods for solving PDEs: 1D heat equation, 2D Poisson equation.
- [ ] Optimization algorithms: gradient-based, derivative-free.
- [ ] Kernel methods: kernel Ridge, Gaussian processes, etc.
- [ ] Divergences and distances for probability distributions: KL divergence, total variation, Wasserstein.
