# Welcome!

Welcome to Rustineers â€“ a learning journey into the Rust programming language through the lens of applied sciences.

The goal of this book is to teach Rust by implementing practical examples from fields such as:

-* Machine Learning
* Statistics and Probability
* Optimization
* Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
* Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Rather than starting with abstract concepts or toy problems, we take a hands-on approach. Each chapter is centered around a concrete scientific computation or algorithm, and we explore how to build it idiomatically in Rust.
