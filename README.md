# Learn Rust with Applied Sciences

Welcome to **Rustineers**, a hands-on guide to learning the Rust programming language through practical problems in applied sciences.

If you enjoy learning a programming language by implementing common algorithms yourself â€” especially in applied mathematics and scientific computing â€” then you're in the right place.

The name _Rustineers_ is a blend of Rust and engineers.
