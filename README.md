# Learn Rust with Applied Sciences

Welcome to Rustineers, a hands-on guide to learning the Rust programming language through practical problems in applied sciences. The name _Rustineers_ is a blend of Rust and engineers.

If you enjoy learning a programming language by implementing common algorithms yourself â€” especially in applied mathematics and scientific computing â€” then you're in the right place.

This project reflects my personal journey learning Rust, so there may be mistakes or things that could be improved. Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR if you spot anything.

If you'd like to contribute your own example from any scientific or engineering field, you're more than welcome to.
